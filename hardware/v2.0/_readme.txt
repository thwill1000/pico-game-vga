PicoGAME 2.0

This is the most flexible PicoGAME release so far. It's a good idea to read the info file several times and look at the circuit before considering what options you'd like, as it can be a bit awkward to change things later. Some things, like an analogue joystick and a RTC are incompatible. You can swap between them with some fiddling in both hardware and software, but only one at once can be installed.

I've included some notes on using the JDY-40 wireless module, but if you decide to fit it (they are very cheap, so why not?) I urge you to track down the manual on line. You'll need it to change communication parameters. 

Many thanks to Geoff Graham for his excellent MMBasic and to Peter Mather for his hard work in porting it (and widely extending it!) for the Raspberry Pi Pico to produce the PicoMite and then the PicoMite VGA Edition. Thanks also to Raspberry Pi, who I think have produced more than originally expected in the Pico. Thanks also to the folks on The Back Shed Forum, which is the spiritual home of everything to do with MMBasic.
